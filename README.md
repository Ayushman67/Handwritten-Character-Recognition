# Handwritten-Character-Recognition
The handwritten character recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten characters. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten characters are not perfect and can be made with many different flavors. The handwritten character recognition is the solution to this problem which uses the image of a character and recognizes the character present in the image.
In this machine learning project, we will recognize handwritten characters, i.e, English alphabets from A-Z. This we are going to achieve by modeling a neural network that will have to be trained over a dataset containing images of alphabets.

The dataset has been taken from kaggle.
